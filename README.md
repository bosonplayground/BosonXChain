# BosonXChain

## Description

Boson Protocol allows decentralized commerce using NFTs encoded with game theory.

When a seller deploys the same offer on different Layer 2 chains, the  supply quantity of items for sale needs to be managed across multiple chains.

So we need a cross-chain inventory synchronization mechanism.

## Details of the solution
A subset of the Boson Protocol contracts was deployed to both the Polygon Mumbai testnet and the Arbitrum testnet. The contract addresses are as follows:
